#!/bin/bash 
#
# Deploy a current project to a local server, or clean the deployments in a
# local server.
#
# To deploy a procject, ldeploy creats a symlink from the server's deployments
# folder to the current folder (which must be the exploded WAR that you would
# like to deploy). Also creates the necessary ".dodeploy" marker file for JBoss.
#
# Usage
# -----
#
# `ldeploy [jboss|tomcat] [clean]`
#
# Examples
# --------
# 
#     ldeploy jboss clean (from any directory)
#
# Removes all deployments in your local JBoss
#
#     ldeploy clean (from any directory)
#
# Same as `ldeploy jboss clean`. Defaults to JBoss.
#
#     cd <exploded_war_path>
#     ldeploy tomcat
# 
# Deploys the current exploded war to Tomcat
#
#    cd <exploded_war_path>
#    ldeploy
#
# Deploys the current exploded war to JBoss. Defaults to JBoss.
